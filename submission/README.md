## Prolog

## CPLex

### Installation

To run the files OPL Model, you need to install [ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio)

### Use

The easy way to organize and run the program with different inputs is to create different ``run configurations`` each one with a different input.

### Test Instruction

We experiment run the code with different sizes of input and verify the result. After creating several ``run configurations`` just run it and you can see all the results of the decision variables.
